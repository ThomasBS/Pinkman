Pinkman
=======

Simple IRC bot written in Node for #devdk

## About

Pinkman was originally created for the danish development and design community #devdk which primary operates on IRC.

Since we have many users and needed some flexibility to guard the channel and availability to execute commands, we created Pinkman.

Pinkman is named after the character from the TV serie Breaking Bad, of which we're all large fans!   
It therefore come as a natural choice to name the bot after a character in the serie.

## Requirements

Pinkman runs on meth and NodeJS.

## Instructions

```
  git clone git@github.com:tkjaergaard/Pinkman.git
  
  npm install
  
  node Pinkman.js
````
  
For the best result, we're recommending that you use it with the package [Forever](https://npmjs.org/package/forever).

## Public commands

* `!tableflip` - Flip that table.
* `!puttableback` - Put that table back.
* `!dice` - Roll the dice.
* `!quote` - Throw a Pinkman quote, bitch!
